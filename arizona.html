							<h3>Understanding the Helium absorption on Hot Jupiter exoplanets</h3>								
								<p> Understanding atmospheric escape is essential for insights into exoplanet demographics, habitability, and star-planet interactions. Hot Jupiters and Neptunes, 
									due to their proximity to host stars, are ideal candidates for studying these escape mechanisms. Observations of the He I 10830 Å line, which indicates escaping helium, 
									show variability in absorption patterns, complicating correlations with mass loss rates. Current models, which often lack detailed energy balance and species chemistry,
									have not fully addressed these complexities. We employ a 1D thermosphere-ionosphere and hydrodynamic escape model, which is more suited for modeling He I (2³S) and H I Balmer 
									lines than the simpler Parker wind models. This model is iteratively integrated with established lower/middle atmosphere models to ensure accuracy. We also use a radiative 
									transfer model to calculate transit depths for H I and He I lines, factoring in various atmospheric conditions.Our research highlights significant gaps in the existing models’ 
									excitation chemistry for He I (2³S). By collaborating with experts to generate new high-resolution photoionization cross-sections and updating critical reaction rates, 
									we have developed more accurate models for the He I 10830 Å line formation. We have applied this model to the archetype Hot Jupiter HD209458b and have very interesting reuslts to share.
									A paper should be coming out soon!</p>
